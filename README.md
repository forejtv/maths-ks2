# Interesting maths topics for year 5 and 6

I've been volunteering to teach maths to kids between 9 and 11 years old at our local primary school. These are the topics I've done.

# Basic combinatorics

# Probability

# Eulerean path/cycle

# Sides of a regular hexagon

# Why are there no flying elephants

# Moebius strip

# Slide rule

# Average speed: going uphill and downhill

# Bike gear ratios

# Measuring height using similar triangles

# Conway's game of life

# Why do astronauts float in space (not really maths)

# GPS positioning basics

# How do computers communicate in binary

# Voronoi diagrams

# Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg

# Map projections

# Synchronisation game

Everyone gets a piece of paper with a number on it, they pass the paper without communicating, in the end everyone has to say the same number. Extension: everybody has to say the same number, but the number must not be from the list.
